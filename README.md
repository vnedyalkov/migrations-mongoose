# migrations-mongoose
Mongoose extension for server-side migrations. Ð¢his add-on allows to safely execute portions of the code, while retaining the current version of the migration and blocking subsequent migrations on error.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install migrations-mongoose -save
```

or include it in `package.json`

## Usage

In order to use mongoose you need running mongodb database and empty collection in which we will keep track of migrations:

```js
const dbpath = 'mongodb://localhost:4001/mydb';
const migrationCollection = 'migrations';
```

Next step is to create migration object:

```js
const Migrator = require('migrations-mongoose');

const dbpath = 'mongodb://localhost:4001/mydb';
const migrationCollection = 'migrations';

const migrator = new Migrator(dbpath, migrationCollection);
```

Then we can add some migrations:

```js
const Migrator = require('migrations-mongoose');

const dbpath = 'mongodb://localhost:4001/mydb';
const migrationCollection = 'migrations';

const migrator = new Migrator(dbpath, migrationCollection);

migrator.add({
    version: 1,
    name: 'Create Initial Admin User',
    up: ()=>{
        // Logic to create your admin user
        // example
        let admin = new Admin();
        admin.save((err, admin) => {
           console.log("admin created.");
        })
    }
});

migrator.add({
    version: 2,
    name: 'Add additional field role to my admin user',
    up: ()=>{
        // Logic add aditional field to your admin
        // example
        Admin.findOne({}, (err, admin) => {
            admin.role = "super admin";
            admin.save((err, admin) => {
               console.log("admin updated.");
            })
        });
    }
});
```

So far so good. Now we have two options to run the migrations:

### Option 1:

This option will run only migration "version 1" and will set migration version to "1".

```js
migrator.migrateTo(1);
```

### Option 2:

This option will trigger all migration to latest version.

```js
migrator.migrate();
```

For example: If you run migrate(). This will execute both migrations. In later stage if you add 1 more additional migration "version 3". Only "version 3" will be execute.

```
Note: I recommend not to use both options at once
```

## On error occur

Ff some kind of error occur while migration is executed, migrations will be locked and you won't be able to run them again. The purpose of this is to prevent unwanted changes to the database.

```
Solution: In order to unlock migrations again, you have to change migration document property locked from 'true' to 'false' into your collection, manualy. In this case collection is named 'migrations', so you need to change document property in this collection.
```
